# TailsMidwest - About
This Next.js website was designed and developed to serve as an online presence for a local animal rescue shelter. 
The goal was to create a user-friendly platform that showcased the shelter's mission, available animals, adoption process, 
and encouraged community involvement.
It's unfortunate that the shelter shut down before completion, 
Here's a brief description of what the website included:

# Features (Planned and Partially Implemented):

* Homepage: A welcoming landing page featuring heartwarming images of rescued animals and an introduction to the shelter's mission and values.
* Animals Available for Adoption: A page where visitors could view profiles of animals currently available for adoption. Each profile would include details about the animal's history, personality, and adoption status.
* Adoption Process: Information about the shelter's adoption process, including requirements, fees, and necessary documentation.
* Donations and Support: Options for visitors to make donations to support the shelter's operations, including a secure payment gateway.
* Volunteer Opportunities: Details about how community members could get involved by volunteering their time or skills.
* News and Events: Updates on shelter events, fundraisers, and animal-related news in the local community.
* Contact Information: A contact page with a form for inquiries, as well as contact details and a map showing the shelter's location.
